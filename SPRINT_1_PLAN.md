   - Implement recipe-specific prompts
   - Fallback to GPT-3.5-turbo

3. **Database Migration** (2 hours)
   - Add recipes table
   - User accounts table
   - Subscription tracking

### Day 3-4: Core Features  
4. **Recipe Extraction API** (6 hours)
   ```python
   POST /v1/extract-recipe
   {
     "url": "pinterest.com/...",
     "user_token": "..."
   }
   ```

## 🔧 Task Assignments

### Backend (Justin to implement)
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD
- [ ] Recipe extraction endpoint
- [ ] Stripe payment integration
- [ ] Database schema updates

### Frontend (Extension)
- [ ] Chrome extension manifest
- [ ] Pinterest detection script
- [ ] Recipe display component
- [ ] Payment flow UI

### AI/Data
- [ ] Recipe extraction prompts
- [ ] Cost optimization
- [ ] Quality validation

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation
1. **Pinterest blocks scraping** → Use official API if available, implement rate limiting
2. **AI costs too high** → Cache results, use cheaper models
3. **Payment friction** → Generous free tier, one-click signup
4. **Poor extraction quality** → Manual recipe database fallback

## ✅ Definition of Done
- [ ] Extension extracts Pinterest recipes in <3 seconds
- [ ] Free tier working (3 recipes tracked)
- [ ] Stripe subscription active
- [ ] CI/CD deploying to production
- [ ] 10 test recipes extracted successfully
- [ ] Extension in Chrome Web Store (pending review)
